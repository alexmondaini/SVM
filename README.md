# SVM-supportvectormachines
This is a project using data from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients). The target variable(response) is binary and it consists of default payments of credit card (Yes = 1, No = 0).

I applied in this project Support Vector Machines in order to predict the classification of credible and not credible clients, and accuracy metrics are implemented throughout the process. You may wish to downlaod the file directly from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/) or download from the [data folder](data/) in this repository.

The project code is on the juptyter notebook called [SVM](SVM.ipynb)
